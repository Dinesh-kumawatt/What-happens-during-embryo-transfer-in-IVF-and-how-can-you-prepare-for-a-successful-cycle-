Embryo transfer is one of the final and most important steps in the IVF process. After fertilization and careful monitoring of embryos in the lab for a few days, one or more healthy embryos are selected for transfer. The doctor uses a thin catheter to gently place the embryo into the uterus, hoping for successful implantation and pregnancy.

The procedure is simple, painless, and doesn’t require anesthesia. Preparing for embryo transfer involves following your doctor’s advice on medications, avoiding stress, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and getting proper rest. Some clinics also recommend acupuncture or other supportive treatments to improve the chances of success.

The success of embryo transfer depends on embryo quality, endometrial thickness, and overall reproductive health. At Ayuh Fertility Centre, every embryo transfer is planned with precision. The lab uses time-lapse monitoring to select the best embryo, and the transfer is done with utmost care and expertise.
